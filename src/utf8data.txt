Artifact Creature — Juggernaut
Juggernaut attacks each turn if able.£Juggernaut can''t be blocked by Walls.
£8/15/2010 : If, during your declare attackers step, Juggernaut is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can''t attack, or is affected by "summoning sickness," then it doesn''t attack. If there''s a cost associated with having Juggernaut attack, you aren''t forced to pay that cost, so it doesn''t have to attack in that case either. £8/15/2010 : If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, Juggernaut must attack only in the first one in which it''s able to. £7/18/2014 : An effect that says “can’t be blocked except by Walls” (for example, the effect of Invisibility) doesn’t override the text on Juggernaut’s last ability. If Juggernaut is affected by such an effect, it can’t be blocked.
